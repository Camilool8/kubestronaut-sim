A team applies the following NetworkPolicy:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: db-allow-api
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: db
  policyTypes:
    - Ingress
  ingress:
    - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: api
      ports:
        - port: 5432
```

Which traffic is allowed to reach Pods labeled `app: db` on port 5432?
